You've been staring at me with a heart of doubt
Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me 'round and 'round
Don't build me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down (Hey)
Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling with your
Feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath
Baby, don't run me 'round and 'round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now
On your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it
Small talk, no conversation
That look makes me impatient
I can't tell what you're thinking
Please tell me what you're thinking
Last night we were more than fine
Just tell me if you changed your mind
If you changed your mind
'Cause I'm all, I'm all in
I'm calling, no answer
Would you text me when you feel like?
When it feels right to you?
But I'm all, I'm all in
I'm falling faster

Baby, don't run me 'round and 'round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now
On your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it
Oh yeah
You know you've got me in the palm of your hand
But I love those hands
Ohh yeah
But you only let me hold you when he can't
Yeah, I don't understand

Hurry home, let's never leave the house
